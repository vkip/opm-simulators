/*
    Here keywords are defined that are fully supported by flow, but nevertheless
    can benefit from a preliminary high-level non-contextual verification.

    The keywords are specified in a mapping with the keyword names as keys, and
    values that describe the set of supported items. These are described by a
    mapping from the item name to a struct of properties, defined in KeywordValidation.hpp.

    This struct has the following fields:

    critical (bool) : if this is a critical error.
    validator (function wrapper) : A function wrapper object that is used to test values.
    message (itemal string): an optional message to add to the error reported by flow.

    For convenience there is a small class KeywordValidation::allow_values which
    can be initialized with a list of permitted values, and used as a validator.
